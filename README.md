## Install TIP (Very IMPORTANT!!)
Because this software is self-signed, so your computer may not trust this installer.  
If you want to make the installer trusted, you can download and install my [certification](https://www.mishui.city/upload/CertForLRS.cer).  
Then, you can run this powershell command:  
*The content enclosed in '<' and '>' needs to be replaced according to the actual situation.  
`Import-Certificate -FilePath "<Your certification file path>" -CertStoreLocation "Cert:\CurrentUser\TrustedPeople"`  

## Features
### Functions
- **File tree sidebar** -- browse all drives and folders in a collapsible tree view, with lazy-loaded subdirectories
- **Sortable file list** -- 4-column table (Name, Modified, Created, Size) with click-to-sort column headers and resizable columns
- **Breadcrumb navigation** -- custom breadcrumb bar with back/forward/up history, editable address bar, and sub-folder flyouts
- **Inline rename** -- click any file or folder name to rename it inline (Enter to commit, Escape to cancel)
- **Context menus** -- right-click menus for file operations (cut, copy, paste, rename, delete) and item creation (new folder, new text document)
- **File operations** -- full clipboard integration with cut/copy/paste via Windows clipboard
- **Theme-aware icons** -- multi-layered icon rendering that adapts to Windows light/dark theme
- **Configurable** -- settings panel for home path, default sort order, row height, and icon provider options
- **Mica backdrop** -- native Windows 11 materials with title bar integration
- **Time-based grouping** -- files grouped by time periods (Today, Yesterday, This Week, etc.)
- **Plugins...** -- Expand the program's functionality with extensions (Plugin dev docs: [docs](https://github.com/Xhscfdj/FastFluentFilesFolders/blob/master/FastFluentFilesFolders/Extensions/PLUGIN_DEV_GUIDE.md)
- **There will be more functions...**
### Performance
- **Fast and fluent** -- the speed of loading directories which has hundreds even thousands of items is very fast(450 items directory doesn't take any time visually). That's because we load the items' info asynchronously.

## Requirements
